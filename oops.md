### OOPS?
OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System.

1. Introduction to OOP:
   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects."
   - Objects contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures/functions.

2. Key Principles of OOP:
   a. Encapsulation:
      - Bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.
      - Data hiding to restrict direct access to certain components of the object.

   b. Inheritance:
      - Ability of a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
      - Promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy of classes.

   c. Polymorphism:
      - Ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
      - Enables flexibility and extensibility in the code.

   d. Abstraction:
      - Process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

3. Classes and Objects:
   - Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining their structure and behavior.
   - Objects are instances of classes, representing real-world entities.

4. Data Hiding:
   - Practice of hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world.
   - Achieved by making data private within a class and controlling access through public methods.

5. Benefits of OOP:
   - Modularity: Encourages breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Reusability: Promotes reuse of classes and objects, reducing redundancy.
   - Flexibility: Allows for easy modification and extension of existing code.
   - Maintainability: Facilitates easier maintenance and debugging of code.

6. Examples of OOP Languages:
   - C++, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, and many others.

7. Conclusion:
   - OOP provides a powerful and flexible way to design and organize code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. Understanding OOP principles is essential for modern software development.
